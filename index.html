        <p class="contentp">I was born in North Carolina and moved around the state to several different cities before I moved to Delaware. When I was preschool I moved to the Philadelphia area and lived there for 8 years. I moved out to Kansas in middle school and graduated high school at Andover High School. I continued my journey at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois.</p>

        <p class="contentp">Recently, I graduated from Bradley University with a bachelor's degree in animation with a minor in studio art. I became familiar with programs like Maya, the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite applications, Cinema4D, and many more programs. I am currently enrolled in Kansas University's Coding Bootcamp to become a web developer. I enjoy graphic design, animation, and front end development though I can't wait to learn more than just those skills. I look forward to learning both front end and back end to become a web developer.</p>

        <p class="contentp">Some fun facts about me include that my favorite animal is a giraffe. I love dogs and my dog's name is Dakota and he is a fox red lab. My favorite color is blue and I love fall and winter over summer and spring. I love to read and usually have a book on my person. And, finally I am a tea drinker and not a coffee drinker.</p>
